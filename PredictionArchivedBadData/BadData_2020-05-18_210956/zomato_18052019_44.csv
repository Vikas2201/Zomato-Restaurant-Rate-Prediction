Mutton Biryani is the best.. the pieces arent too bony... Veg biryani is pretty good as well, chicken Biryani is between ok and good.. starters are tasty, over all limited options, but these options are pretty good..however if Ur not used to spicy food take ur ant acids before u go to bed...the day u eat from here'), ('Rated 4.0', ""RATED\n  The taste is priority than ambience, I loved the taste of Redddy's hot and Birinz special bone less biryani they both taste awesome after a long time I had my kind of biryani.""), ('Rated 1.0', ""RATED\n  Repeated counts of wrong delivery service, be it via any delivery app, these guys just don't seem to understand the order placed and send wrong orders without even confirming with the customer. Prawn Biryani order becomes Paneer and Chicken Biryani becomes boneless chicken biryani without even asking you. The point is, if you can't deliver the right order.. just make sure you call the customer and confirm it.\nBeing a foodie, I have had good feedback about you guys but the recent orders have forced me to rate you to this.""), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  After pondering where to order my Biriyani from and debating all the options available around jayanagar I decided to go with birinz this weekend. We ordered the butter chicken Biriyani and Andhra chilli chicken. The hot and spicy chilli chicken complimented the rich butter chicken Biriyani. We polished off the entire serving and literally didn?t even leave a grain of rice.'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  Visited this restaurant with few of my friends for a weekend lunch. Had heard a lot about their biryani and the varieties of toppings they provide. The ambiance of the place is normal. Located on the btm main road. You won?t find much difficulty to locate the place.\nWe started with some dry starters which had chef special chicken starters, Prawns dry fry, and coke, for the main course we ordered a Hyderabadi chicken biryani, Butter chicken biryani and boneless chicken biryani. Everything was up to the mark.butter chicken biryani I had tried for the first time but to my surprise it was not at all sweet. Was very buttery and and yummy in taste.i would love to visit again and also get the biryani homedelivered'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  This is located in BTM and I guess if your looking to have a variety of biriyanis.. this is really the go to place!!\nWe went as a group of 10 so I guess we ordered atleast 5-6 starters and almost all the chicken fish and prawn biriyanis available on their menu..\nFor the biriyani the rice is same for all and it?s good too.. just the masalas change for each type.. so I really don?t know which biriyani is the best!\nBut the staff is not very friendly.. you need to keep asking them if you need something which was something at times we got a bit irritated\nMy overall rating\nFood 5/5\nAmbience 4/5\nStaff behaviour 3/5\nValue for money 5/5\n\nThis is available in Zomato Gold as well!! And a good option in that area for biriyani cravings ?'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  If you are a biryani lover, you must visit this place. Not much of any ambience or anything. But it definitely has a lot of options for biryani starting from chicken to mutton to fish biryani?s. We ordered mutton shorba, which was one of the best I?ve ever had. Then we ordered mutton mughlai biryani and gongura mutton biryani. Both of them were awesome, rich and flavorful taste. I would definitely go back here to try out the remaining ones.'), ('Rated 4.0', ""RATED\n  Their menu listed Ulavacharu Biryani and says open till mid night which prompted us to visit this restaurant on Sunday night. To our disappointment the dish was not avaialble but the waiter recommended Reddy's Red Hot Biryani, Other dishes we ordered were Egg Biryani with Dum rice and baby corn starter. Their recommendation was top class and still tasted fresh, one of the best biryani I have had for a long time. Other dishes were above average. My son wanted ice cream which was not available but they allowed us to get desserts from a shop Immeidate next to it. Have not taken pics this time as we were busy hogging food?. Ambience was nice and Staff were super friendly and service was excellent which made me give a 4/5. Next visit will be with a group of friends and I'll update feedback.\n\nLike I said I went for 2nd visit with friends and we tried pretty much all the chicken starters including their biriyanis. Yes, Ulavacharu Biriyani too.""), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  Had one of the finest hyderabadi biriyani from there. Good quality basmati rice with succulent pieces of nicely cooked chicken on top.

Good service.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Was in Bangalore for a day , order our dinner from Birinz , We ordered for :\nPaneer Sholey: Paneer pieces tossed in ginger ,garlic onion, coloured pepper . really enjoyed the flavors.\n\nReddy?s Chicken Biryani : Boneless chicken biryani . Flavors were beautiful but then i found it a little too spicy, it was served with raita and a gravy to go with.\n\nOver all i liked this restaurant will definitely order everytime i am in Bangalore.\n\nCheers.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Birinz has been a delivery only Biriyani place for years. And now this is a restaurant which they have launched recently. They serve 10/12 different varieties of andhra biryanis. The rice remains the same in all , the long basmati rice with nice aroma which you get in all andhra biryanis. Considering the food alone, it?s 5/5 any day. But as a restaurant, it think there is scope for improvement on service and ambience. ACs were not switched even with all the seats occupied on a Sunday afternoon. There is continuous clamour at the reception with a huge crowd for delivery orders and the staffs runnings around for that. They can manage their delivery system in a better way so that it doesn?t affect the restaurant ambience or service.'), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\n  Everyday is Biryani day and today was no different !!!
